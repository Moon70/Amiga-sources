# Amiga Sources

Here are some of the Amiga sources i´ve written in the past millenium, as a member of the [Demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene "Wikipedia") group Abyss.

Language: Motorola 68k Assembler

Assembler: ASM-One

I´d like to say '**thank you**' to everybody who´s preserving Demoscene productions by uploading and maintaining various great sites (don´t want to mention some, so that i can´t forget the others) and to those who create videos for YouTube.

## High Anxiety

Demo released by Abyss in summer 1995 at [Assembly 1995](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_(demoparty))  in Helsinki/Finland.

Dexter is the main coder of this demo. I don´t have his sources, so here are only the parts i´ve contributed.           I remember Dexter and me putting all together at the party, that was great :-)

## Music For The Lost

2-Disc Musicdisc released by Abyss in July 1993.

Contains the Prorunner V2.0 source by Cosmos/Sanity.

The code also contains (at least) two bugs, unknown at the time of release:

+ A bug in the trackdisc loader, which causes some kind of looping when using low quality or worn discs.
+ When i was creating a HD-Version, i noticed that there must be another bug in the vector graphics code, leading to a system crash when exiting the musicdisc and returning to the operating system. Doesn´t occur when booting from disc, since there´s no exit. Because that was about 1 year after release, i decided not to spend time to fix that.
