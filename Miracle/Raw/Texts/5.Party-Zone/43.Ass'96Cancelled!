Yes,you readed right,Read all about it here in the offical file from the
Assembly organizers.
They Have cancelled Assembly'96 as they have got some money trouble,but will
maybe be back next year.... Here is the Original Text:



ÿ2b0iiuThis is the official announcement of the Assembly Situation.

ÿ2c0iiuThere has been a lot of speculation what will happen and what the situation is.
I hope this news posting will clear most of it, and I hope people will spread it
across the networks.



ÿ2b0iiu1) The moneyÿ2c0iiu

        Assembly '95 still owes people prizes in money. A very annoying
        situation that we still work on. Romware has _finally_ made the asm '95
        cd out and we are waiting for the sales data (but don't bee too
        optimistic, we are not. We had the rom ready at the beginning of October
        but its out just now...).
        From this money, all will be spent on prizes. We will have a website to
        serve people on the internet - it will come up soonish,we only need some
        gfx for it.

        From all this we will give all money to the prizes. Also,at some point,
        there will be a list of people whom have been paid so you can check the
        situation if need be.

        Some people have made 'threats' of sueing: it is ok. They are allowed to
        do that but at that point we don't see any reason to continue our work
        so it is solely up to people to do what they want.
        The situation isn't easy for us either, as we made the best party ever
        and now the glory has been stained with this incident.
        Years of nonpaying work for nothing.

ÿ2b0iiu2) Assembly '96ÿ2c0iiu

        The party will not be held. Mainly the reason is that we don't
        want to start organizing anything with prizes still unpaid.
        I hope someone can organize a good summer event here in Finland
        and we shall see what happens at 97 :)

The people whom have been promised CDs will get them as soon as we get
them from Romware. We have received 10 promotional CDs, thats all.

In general, people have been very supportive. I thank you all whom
have called or mailed us and whom have had the patience. Those kinds of
spirits are rare nowadays and I thank you for giving us some extra
strength to continue the work that is still in process. Lots of things
have happened, there has been lots of hopes, and now we have decided
the way we take. I am sorry if I have missed some emails, I have tried
to reply every one but I have had a lot of work here, so I apologize
if some of you haven't received a reply.

Assembly '96 would have rocked, with 2M ethernets and links abroad,
lotsa new features and stuff for people to enjoy. But again, I hope
people understand why we don't want to have it, and I feel we have made
the right choise althou it feels quite sad.

SO, why this all happened? There has been quite wild rumours about it,
but in short: the damages to the fair centre were a bit too big and
the insurance company did not pay one sigle penny. Also, we got few
extra bills that were quite unremarkable but still justified. So, you
can thank all those people who painted the walls, broke windows and
demolished the toilets. We should have had the rule that all the
damages would be taken from the prizes... that way, the damages would
have been quite much smaller too.
Be it then a success or not, we are working to get the prizes paid.
And I think they will be eventually, I don't want to give up if people
still have faith that they will get their shares.

Well, I think this has been short. If someone else wants to know about
the situation they are free to mail us at assembly@assembly.org, but
please give us some time to reply, we are quite busy with other work.

I can be reached by email at pehu@assembly.org

Yours sincerely
