Some of you could ask what is Hungary? No, it's not a wild animal and it is not
the latest Ciccolina film either, but it's a small country in middle-east
Europe. And last weekend in a suburb of this state's capital, a party was held
once again (2nd time) in the last 100 years. Last year's Scenest was also a big
success (with 600 visitors - which was the biggest hungarian party ever), but
this year more than 900 ppl bought (or not) ticket for it.

Hungary is a fairly cheap place, thus the entrance price was just 7 DM, too
(1.5 pizza at Symposium'96) The place itself was a school (or at least seemed
such a place, before we went there)
Since I was (told to be) one of the organizers, I had to go there still on
friday. I couldn't do anything until 8 o'clock in the evening. Too many PC
lamers were hanging around and since I know just a few pc fans I rather thought
to discover the local area with some friends. But meanwhile some austrians
arrived. I realized Zinkfloid's (Uyanik!) face too among them.
Since we had a great time still on Hammering'94 (ehh?), Zinkfloid needn't had to
persuade me to go downtown together. So, Beast/Majic12, Zinkfloid, and me wanted
to go downtown. but we could have gone 2 corners only, because we noticed a sign
say 'Guinness' and we couldn't pass by that place. So, we went in. Soon, it
became the official Scenest pub, because in 2 hours the place got full of
partyfreaks, and just after some of my hard boozer friends released some
disgusting stuff on the floor, all non-party freak left the place. We stayed
there until 2 o'clock or something. Then we 'walked' back to the party.

The sleeping places (because there were several) were really silent (no rave
concert nor snoring men - because my noise beated everbody)
I got up at 10, on saturday. I went with car (thx to Frame18 for the car) for
the guitarist of Akela (the no.1 hungarian metal band! Really proffesional guy),
because he and me! (laugh) planned a concert at noon. We picked up Gyuszi (the
guitarist) with all his equipment. The way there took 10 mins, back 1 hour.
I hate high-ways.  The concert delayed to 2 o'clock. We stuffed both guitar, but
then the real professional conceited studio faces, whose task was servicing the
music and sounds during the party, couldn't plug our Marshall amplifier to their
10000 DM equipment, so we should have played without guitar amplifier (the same
effect, if you plug your guitar to your home hifi system...simple suxx) but then
another prob. It was impossible to plug 2 guitars at the same time there to
sound as we wanted. So, Gyuszi and me had to play alone. First Gyuszi didn't
want to play * belive, he is very famous hungarian guitarist and without
equipment it would have been a big blame for him *, but I persuaded him (redwine
was the keyword) and he played half an hour at last. Everybody was surprised how
good he played, even big tekkno fans came in the hall, and wondered what the
hell is the music..... And then I turned.... I wanted to play classical songs
(Bach, Carcassi, Sor etc.), but it was impossible to mix classical (or at least
lyric) guitar sound on the biiig 10000 DM equipment, so at last only 2 ppl left
in the hall (Gyuszi and I)
Saturday afternoon: Nothing special. I brought my bbs there and everybody
                    made free hd leech.
evening: at 6 i met with the austrians again, and we joined up together to the
         official Scenest pub staff (Poko: are you Slayer? ;))
we had to leave the place at 9, because the compos started. To be honest after
the music compo, I don't remember anything, only, we left and went somewhere.
Anyway, somehow, i found myself sunday morning in the sleepinghall.
Then before cleaning the place, i had to rush home for my brother's birthday ;)

Summerized: the organizing of the party was no doubt very great (because
            i was in the staff, too) The prices were very low (e.g half DM
            for 4 dl coke, or 0.8 DM for a huuuge warm-sandwich),
            friendly security (after showing them what baseball-bat is)
            clean partyplace, no messing, clean lavatories, and nnt to forget:
            more than 900 visitors and about 16-17 foreigners, too

           I'm really looking forward occupying the Scenest pub again,
                            on the next Scenest'97.
