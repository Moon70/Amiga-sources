I am very proud to welcome you to the very first issue of Miracle on the Amiga!
It's a mag mainly for the swappers, which will also try to give one of the best
Charts around, which surely depends on support, so please help us!

ÿ220iiuWe are very sorry for the delayed issue 1, which is delayed by several reasons,
I know it's not the best beginning, but now as everything is finally finished,
we hope to release Miracle quite regular in the future :)

ÿ210iiuAs you see this first issue is not that well designed, and is actually released
with a minimum code, but more will be implemented afterwards, just be patient,
and we will include some more features in the following issues...
We just wont delay it any more, and say that ÿ270iiuwe are here to Stay!ÿ210iiu ,thats why!

ÿ220iiuMiracle, just another diskmag you might wonder? NO!- Miracle has actually been
released 9 issues before, but then under the ÿ240iiuMANIAXÿ220iiu label, on the c64, for some
years ago! But as it sadly died, it's now finally time for it's reborn on the
amiga, and I hope you will like it.

ÿ210iiuWe will not be a "real" diskmag, if it's that you are looking for, but a mag
which will try to give you the best charts on the amiga scene, including lots of
news and addys'n messages, we will also try to run a party-zone with party
reports/infos and results, but as with everything, it surely depends on SUPPORT!
Miracle will also include a Birth-Dates Chapter in every issue. Thats why you
could write it on the votesheet if you want, and if you have a lot of birthdates
laying around, why not send them to us, so we could publish them!- as we really
want to make this chapter as complete as possible, but we need ofcourse your
support for this one!

ÿ220iiuWe will not be so very serious about other articles, but we will publish
everything we receive as a "Bonus" for you, so if it's really something you
wanna tell the scene, then send your articles to us!
This issue will hopefully be the worst? which will be released, with quite few
votes, but just enough to show a minimum of what can be called charts, and
mostly of the news are very old now, as they have been collected over about
a 1/2 year now. This issue of miracle was actually meant to be released in
January, so thats why.

ÿ210iiuIt's only released to show that we are born on the amiga, and that we need ÿ240iiuYOURÿ210iiu
support!- to keep us alive, and to make a good swappers mag! I really belive in
this project to be a good mag, and I have already some experience from the C64,
where we actually made it pretty good! But as this mag project surely depends
on support, I will not promise anything! But I will do my best!

ÿ220iiuMiracle will be released regular in the future, every 2 or 3 months, ofcourse
depending on the support coming in! If the support will be excellent sometime,it
might be a monthly magazine!

ÿ210iiuI hope you will belive in us, and support us! The most important is to VOTE!
Thanks in advance, and lets the future look bright, and show all the chartmagz
around how real charts should look like!...
And to repeat it once more, the main reason for releasing this mag is to give
the amiga scene a real chartmag, but to let that happen it surely depends on
support! Do you really think there will be good charts by only voting on top 3?
Do you really think it's enough to show the top 10 or 20? If yes, then miracle
will not be for you, but if you think you have to vote on top 5, and want to see
the complete ranking, even if it is top 100!- then you should tune in to Miracle
for the future!- and I will promise you good charts, as long as I get enough
support!. I have to admit that personally I think even voting on top 5's is too
littel, on the c64 you had the opportunity to vote on top 10's...
But as it looks like mostly amiga freaks are too lazy to fill out top 10's
I have chosen to only let you vote on top 5's as I think I might get some more
of you out there to vote then, but I might be open for suggestions here....
Have I got it wrong, and you are really interested in voting on top 10's?
One good thing about top 10's is that there will be far more entries in the
charts, but it might result in too many of you will keep away from voting, as
it might take some more of your time?... just let me know....

ÿ220iiuThats all for this time,And I hope to see you all in next issue,and try to
enjoy this issue!                                          ÿ270iiuSigned - mJ -

ÿ210iiuHello everybody!

ÿ220iiuThis is Moon, writing some introducing words...
At first I want to welcome you to issue one of Miracle. As mJ said before,
this first issue is more a kind of live-sign, coz it's now a couple of
months ago since the first votesheets were spreaded. And since the support
was better than expected (for an unborn mag), the news, advertisments and some
other articles are quite old now. That's why we decided to release
issue one in this state of developenemt.

Since Miracle was well-known on the C64 (a Maniacs release) I decided to
make at least the first issue(s) runable on nonAGA-machines.
I try to make an AGA-version as soon as possible, but due to my other
activities (Hi Felix, Ghandy and Substance) this will take some time.

If you check out any bugs in the code, any guru-meditations, if the
program just 'hangs up', if your mouse starts to move or even if mushrooms
start to grow out of your monitor-->don't cry, it's no reason for suicide.
I say this mainly coz I sadly had not very much time to test the code, so
if something unexpected happens, just write me a short note. If you
send also a disc you will receive the next issue as soon as possible.

Enuff blablabla now, have fun and enjoy Miracle, Yours Moon/Abyss/MsV/K!
