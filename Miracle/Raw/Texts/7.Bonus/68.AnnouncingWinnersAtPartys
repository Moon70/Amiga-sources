                          Announcing Winners At Partys

It was the same at SS95, at TP5, at TG96.When the winners were to be announced,
it sucked! The reasons were all different. At SS95, the soundequipment failed.
At TP5, the organizer announcing the winners SUCKED. At TG96 none were paying
attention, as the results had been on the net for quite a long time (bummer for
the amiga-owners!). Besides, five sixths of all the people had left the party.
Why can't we have a decent announciation of the winners? It doesn't have to be
anything fancy, just a brief text at the big screen informing:

- The POSITION
- The NUMBER in the competition
- The ARTIST
- The PRICE

Of course, it would be a scoop, if a small sample of the work could be shown/
played at the same time, but just these few things have never worked out.
It just isn't good enough to know,that eg. Jazz was fifth in the music-compo at
TP5. I mean, the competition was anonymous, so (almost) noone knew, which module
had actually won. It just felt so stupid sitting there, when you had voted for a
number in a compo,and only got to hear the name of the composer. Luckily,
I later got my hands on all the modules from the competition, but I had to wait
for two months! Let's have some better announcements in the future.
I'm sure, that someone could fix a little scaleprogram, that showed some
graphics or played some music, whilst showing the above mentioned four
informations. Is that too hard?
